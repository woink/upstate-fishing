            Use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` to highlight specific code issues inline.
            Use `gh pr comment` for top-level summary feedback.

            After completing your review, you MUST submit a formal GitHub review verdict:
            - If the PR is acceptable: `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --approve -b "your summary"`
            - If changes are needed: `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --request-changes -b "your summary"`

            Every review must end with one of these two commands. Do not skip the verdict.
